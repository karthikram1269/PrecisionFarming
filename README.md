🌱 Precision Farming: AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Solution 🚜

Excited to share my work on Precision Farming, a web-based application designed to help farmers boost agricultural productivity using AI and Machine Learning. This project integrates leaf disease detection, crop recommendation, and fertilizer suggestions to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Leaf Disease Detection: Upload plant leaf images to identify diseases and get treatment recommendations.
✅ Smart Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests the best crops and fertilizers based on soil properties and weather data.
✅ Market Price Prediction: Helps farmers estimate crop prices for better financial planning.
✅ User-Friendly Web Interface: Ensures easy accessibility for farmers and stakeholders.

💡 My Role in the Project:
🔹 Developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth user experience.
🔹 Integrated Machine Learning models for disease detection and crop recommendations.
🔹 Managed the backend with Python and Flask, ensuring seamless data processing.
🔹 Handled MySQL database integration for storing and analyzing soil test results.

This project was a great learning experience, combining AI, data science, and web development to support sustainable farming. Looking forward to working on more impactful tech-driven solutions! 🚀
